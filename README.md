The Tribute Page project is my second project for my internship at OASIS INFOBYTE, where I created a responsive tribute page using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.This website dedicated to honoring the achievements and career of the legendary cricketer, Virat Kohli. The site features several sections, including an introduction highlighting Kohli's impact on the game and his inspirational journey from humble beginnings to cricketing stardom. 

The About section provides a detailed overview of Kohli's life, starting from his early days in Delhi to his rise as one of the most successful cricketers in the world. It covers his career beginnings, international achievements, and his role as a captain, showcasing his leadership skills and cricketing acumen.

Additionally, the site includes a video section featuring highlights from Kohli's career, allowing users to relive some of his most memorable moments on the field. The Career section delves into Kohli's performance across different formats of the game, including Test cricket, ODI, T20, and IPL, highlighting his dominance and impact in each format.

The Achievements Corner showcases Kohli's remarkable achievements, including multiple ICC awards, record-breaking performances, and his impact as a captain and player. The section is a testament to Kohli's excellence and his status as one of the greatest cricketers of all time.

Finally, the Gallery section offers a visual journey through Kohli's career, featuring images that capture his passion, determination, and love for the game. Overall, the Tribute Page project is a fitting tribute to Virat Kohli, celebrating his legacy and inspiring cricket fans around the world.
